# EngineOfEvil

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 setup of https://github.com/tmf7/Engine-of-Evil and it's dependencies. It should be clear that the Copyright of EngineOfEvil and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
